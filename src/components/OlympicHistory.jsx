                            The Olympic Games began in 776 BC in ancient Greece at Olympia. These games were held in honor of Zeus, the chief Greek god. Competitions included events like running, wrestling, and chariot racing. They were not only a major athletic event but also a significant religious and cultural festival, symbolizing unity among Greek city-states.

                            The modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 by Pierre de Coubertin. The first modern Games took place in Athens, Greece, and saw 13 nations competing in 43 events. Over the years, the Olympics have expanded to include a vast array of sports and athletes from all corners of the globe.
